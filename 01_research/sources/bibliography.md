## 1. Hermeneutical Theory & Theological Method

Core philosophical foundations for understanding interpretive complexity in religious texts.

### 1.1 Gadamer, Hans-Georg. *Truth and Method*. 2nd rev. ed. Continuum, 2004.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Hermeneutical circle, fusion of horizons, effective-historical consciousness
**Project Application:** Foundational for understanding why AI cannot simply "process" religious texts—interpretation requires situatedness and historical awareness. Informs the "hermeneutical flattening" critique.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Distanciation, appropriation, surplus of meaning
**Project Application:** Ricoeur's concept of "surplus of meaning" directly supports epistemic modesty—texts carry more meaning than any single interpretation can capture. Basis for `[DEFERRED]` indicator.

### 1.3 Thiselton, Anthony C. *New Horizons in Hermeneutics*. Zondervan, 1992.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Speech-act theory applied to biblical interpretation, reader-response dynamics
**Project Application:** Connects hermeneutics to action/consequence, relevant for tool-calling patterns that have real-world effects on researcher understanding.

### 1.4 Vanhoozer, Kevin J. *Is There a Meaning in This Text?* Zondervan, 1998.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Authorial intention vs. reader construction, hermeneutical realism
**Project Application:** Addresses tensions between objective/subjective dimensions of interpretation—directly relevant to what AI can and cannot determine.

## 2. Personalist Philosophy & Anthropology

Foundations for human-centered AI design that respects dignity and agency.

### 2.1 Mounier, Emmanuel. *Personalism*. University of Notre Dame Press, 1952.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Person as irreducible, engagement, community
**Project Application:** Core philosophical grounding for why AI must serve persons rather than replace interpretive agency. Informs all three design innovations.

### 2.2 Buber, Martin. *I and Thou*. Scribner, 1958.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** I-Thou vs. I-It relations, dialogue, presence
**Project Application:** AI-researcher interaction should approach I-Thou dialogue rather than I-It instrumentalism. Informs the "Collaborative Reasoning" engagement level.

### 2.3 Wojtyla, Karol. *The Acting Person*. Reidel, 1979.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Self-determination, self-possession, transcendence in action
**Project Application:** The researcher must remain the "acting person"—AI assists but does not usurp agency. Grounds the human-centered tool-calling patterns.

### 2.4 Levinas, Emmanuel. *Totality and Infinity*. Duquesne University Press, 1969.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** The face of the Other, ethical asymmetry, infinity
**Project Application:** Religious texts mediate encounters with otherness that AI cannot fully represent. Supports epistemic modesty about theological claims.
