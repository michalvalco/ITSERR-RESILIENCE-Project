## 1. Hermeneutical Theory & Theological Method

Core philosophical foundations for understanding interpretive complexity in religious texts.

### 1.1 Gadamer, Hans-Georg. *Truth and Method*. 2nd rev. ed. Continuum, 2004.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Hermeneutical circle, fusion of horizons, effective-historical consciousness
**Project Application:** Foundational for understanding why AI cannot simply "process" religious texts—interpretation requires situatedness and historical awareness. Informs the "hermeneutical flattening" critique.

### 1.2 Ricoeur, Paul. *Interpretation Theory: Discourse and the Surplus of Meaning*. Texas Christian University Press, 1976.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Distanciation, appropriation, surplus of meaning
**Project Application:** Ricoeur's concept of "surplus of meaning" directly supports epistemic modesty—texts carry more meaning than any single interpretation can capture. Basis for `[DEFERRED]` indicator.

### 1.3 Thiselton, Anthony C. *New Horizons in Hermeneutics*. Zondervan, 1992.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Speech-act theory applied to biblical interpretation, reader-response dynamics
**Project Application:** Connects hermeneutics to action/consequence, relevant for tool-calling patterns that have real-world effects on researcher understanding.

### 1.4 Vanhoozer, Kevin J. *Is There a Meaning in This Text?* Zondervan, 1998.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Authorial intention vs. reader construction, hermeneutical realism
**Project Application:** Addresses tensions between objective/subjective dimensions of interpretation—directly relevant to what AI can and cannot determine.

## 2. Personalist Philosophy & Anthropology

Foundations for human-centered AI design that respects dignity and agency.

### 2.1 Mounier, Emmanuel. *Personalism*. University of Notre Dame Press, 1952.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Person as irreducible, engagement, community
**Project Application:** Core philosophical grounding for why AI must serve persons rather than replace interpretive agency. Informs all three design innovations.

### 2.2 Buber, Martin. *I and Thou*. Scribner, 1958.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** I-Thou vs. I-It relations, dialogue, presence
**Project Application:** AI-researcher interaction should approach I-Thou dialogue rather than I-It instrumentalism. Informs the "Collaborative Reasoning" engagement level.

### 2.3 Wojtyla, Karol. *The Acting Person*. Reidel, 1979.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Self-determination, self-possession, transcendence in action
**Project Application:** The researcher must remain the "acting person"—AI assists but does not usurp agency. Grounds the human-centered tool-calling patterns.

### 2.4 Levinas, Emmanuel. *Totality and Infinity*. Duquesne University Press, 1969.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** The face of the Other, ethical asymmetry, infinity
**Project Application:** Religious texts mediate encounters with otherness that AI cannot fully represent. Supports epistemic modesty about theological claims.

## 3. AI Ethics & Responsible Design

Frameworks for ethically-grounded AI development.

### 3.1 Floridi, Luciano, and Josh Cowls. "A Unified Framework of Five Principles for AI in Society." *Harvard Data Science Review* 1, no. 1 (2019).

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, explicability
**Project Application:** Standard ethical framework. The prototype should demonstrate all five principles, especially autonomy (human control) and explicability (transparency).

### 3.2 Jobin, Anna, Marcello Ienca, and Effy Vayena. "The Global Landscape of AI Ethics Guidelines." *Nature Machine Intelligence* 1 (2019): 389–399.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Meta-analysis of AI ethics principles globally
**Project Application:** Provides empirical grounding for which ethical principles have broad consensus.

### 3.3 Mittelstadt, Brent. "Principles Alone Cannot Guarantee Ethical AI." *Nature Machine Intelligence* 1 (2019): 501–507.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Implementation gap, professional norms, enforcement
**Project Application:** Critical perspective—principles must be operationalized. The prototype demonstrates how to move from principle to implementation.

### 3.4 Crawford, Kate. *Atlas of AI*. Yale University Press, 2021.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Material conditions of AI, labor, environmental costs, power
**Project Application:** Broader context for responsible AI—not just interaction design but systemic considerations.

## 4. Digital Humanities & Religious Studies

Methodological approaches to computational analysis of religious materials.

### 4.1 Schreibman, Susan, Ray Siemens, and John Unsworth, eds. *A New Companion to Digital Humanities*. Wiley-Blackwell, 2016.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** DH methodologies, text analysis, visualization, archives
**Project Application:** Contextualizes the project within DH discourse. Relevant chapters on text analysis and hermeneutics.

### 4.2 Bod, Rens. *A New History of the Humanities*. Oxford University Press, 2013.

**Relevance:** 🟢 Helpful
**Key Concepts:** Pattern-seeking across humanities disciplines
**Project Application:** Historical perspective on how humanities have always involved pattern recognition—AI continues this tradition with new tools.

### 4.3 Piotrowski, Michael. *Natural Language Processing for Historical Texts*. Morgan & Claypool, 2012.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** NLP challenges with historical texts, OCR, normalization
**Project Application:** Technical challenges specific to historical religious texts. Informs integration with GNORM's annotation pipeline.

### 4.4 Moretti, Franco. *Distant Reading*. Verso, 2013.

**Relevance:** 🟡 Important
**Key Concepts:** Distant vs. close reading, literary history at scale
**Project Application:** Useful contrast—this project emphasizes *close* reading assistance rather than distant reading. The prototype should support deep engagement, not just pattern extraction.

## 5. AI Agents & Technical Architecture

Technical foundations for agent implementation.

### 5.1 Yao, Shunyu, et al. "ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models." *ICLR 2023*.

**Relevance:** 🔴 Essential
**Key Concepts:** Reasoning traces, action generation, interleaving thought and action
**Project Application:** Foundational agent architecture. The prototype will extend ReAct patterns with epistemic indicators.

### 5.2 Park, Joon Sung, et al. "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior." *UIST 2023*.
