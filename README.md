## Project Overview

**Fellowship:** ITSERR Transnational Access (TNA) Fellowship  
**Host Institution:** University of Palermo (UniPa)  
**Dates:** February 10–27, 2026  
**Project Title:** *Designing Ethically-Grounded AI Agents for Religious Studies Research: From Personalist Anthropology to Technical Implementation*

### Executive Summary

This project bridges twenty years of theological hermeneutics with AI agent development, aiming to create a philosophical-technical framework for AI tools in religious studies that respect hermeneutical complexity. The work is conducted in collaboration with the University of Palermo's Software Lab and the GNORM project team, led by Dr. Arianna Maria Pavone.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Working Paper:** "Personalist Foundations for AI-Assisted Theological Research"
2. **Functional Prototype:** AI agent with narrative memory, epistemic modesty indicators, and human-centered tool-calling patterns
3. **Technical Documentation:** Philosophical annotations mapping principles to implementation decisions
4. **Final Presentation:** For ITSERR consortium partners
5. **Blog Post:** For ITSERR/RESILIENCE website (due March 2026)

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **LangChain / LangGraph** — Agent orchestration
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — Tool integration
- **Vector Database** — Semantic memory (ChromaDB or similar)

## Core Innovations

### 1. Narrative Memory System
Contextual continuity across research sessions, preserving the hermeneutical journey.

### 2. Epistemic Modesty Indicators
Clear differentiation between factual, interpretive, and deferred-to-human responses.

### 3. Human-Centered Tool-Calling Patterns
Ensuring the researcher maintains agency and control throughout AI-assisted inquiry.

## Levels of AI Engagement in Religious Studies Research

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Information Retrieval | Minimal interpretive intervention |
| 2 | Structured Synthesis | Organizing, pattern identification |
| 3 | Interpretive Assistance | Suggesting connections, flagging tensions |
| 4 | Collaborative Reasoning | Dialogue-based exploration |

## Context: ITSERR & RESILIENCE

**ITSERR** (Italian Strengthening of the ESFRI RI RESILIENCE) enhances the **RESILIENCE** infrastructure — *Religious Studies Infrastructure: tooLs, Innovation, Experts, coNnections and Centres in Europe*.

### Relevant Work Packages

| WP | Name | Relevance |
|----|------|-----------|
