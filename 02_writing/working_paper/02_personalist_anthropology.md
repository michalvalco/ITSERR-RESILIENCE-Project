# Section 2: Personalist Anthropology and Its Implications for AI Design

## 2.1 Introduction to Personalism

Personalism is a philosophical tradition that places the human person—not merely the individual, but the person in their relational, embodied, and spiritual wholeness—at the center of ethical and metaphysical reflection. This paper draws primarily on three thinkers:

- **Emmanuel Mounier** (1905-1950): French philosopher who founded the personalist movement, emphasizing the person as engaged, communal, and transcendent.
- **Martin Buber** (1878-1965): Jewish philosopher whose I-Thou/I-It distinction illuminates the nature of authentic encounter.
- **Karol Wojtyla** (1920-2005): Polish philosopher (later Pope John Paul II) whose phenomenological personalism emphasizes the "acting person" and self-determination.

## 2.2 Three Foundational Claims

### Claim 1: The Person as Irreducible Interpreter

> "The human person is not merely a processor of information but a situated interpreter whose understanding is shaped by formation, tradition, and encounter."

Drawing on Mounier's concept of *engagement*, we argue that interpretation is not a cognitive operation that can be replicated computationally, but an existential act of the whole person. The researcher brings to the text their formation, their questions, their hopes—what Gadamer would call their "horizon."

**Implication for AI design**: AI cannot replicate the existential situatedness that grounds theological interpretation. It can assist but not replace the person-as-interpreter. Systems must be designed to support, not supplant, interpretive agency.

### Claim 2: Dialogue Over Instrumentalism

> "Authentic knowledge emerges through I-Thou encounter, not I-It manipulation."

Buber's distinction between I-Thou and I-It modes of relation provides a framework for thinking about human-AI interaction. When we treat the other (whether human or text or even tool) as an "It" to be used, we diminish both the other and ourselves. When we approach in the I-Thou mode, we remain open to genuine encounter.

**Implication for AI design**: The AI-researcher relationship should approach dialogue—mutual responsiveness, transparency, respect for the other's contribution—rather than pure instrumentalism where AI is merely a tool to be wielded.

This does not anthropomorphize the AI; rather, it demands that the AI be designed to invite the researcher's active engagement rather than passive consumption.

### Claim 3: Agency Preservation

> "The researcher must remain the 'acting person' who takes responsibility for interpretive judgments."

Wojtyla's phenomenology of the acting person emphasizes *self-determination*—the capacity to be the author of one's own acts. In research, this means the scholar must remain the one who judges, decides, and takes responsibility for interpretive claims.

**Implication for AI design**: AI designs that subtly shift interpretive agency to the machine undermine the researcher's self-determination. The framework insists on explicit markers that preserve human agency—making clear what is the AI's contribution and what requires human judgment.

## 2.3 Hermeneutical Theory

Personalist insights are complemented by hermeneutical philosophy, particularly:

### Gadamer: The Hermeneutical Circle and Effective-Historical Consciousness

- **The hermeneutical circle**: Understanding proceeds through iterative engagement between part and whole, text and interpreter. AI can support this process but cannot stand outside it.
- **Effective-historical consciousness**: Every interpreter brings a "horizon" shaped by history and tradition. AI lacks such a horizon; it simulates pattern recognition without genuine historical consciousness.

### Ricoeur: Distanciation and Appropriation

- **Distanciation**: The text's autonomy from its original context allows objective analysis. AI excels here.
- **Appropriation**: Making the text's meaning one's own remains irreducibly personal. AI cannot perform this act.

### The Surplus of Meaning

Texts, especially sacred texts, carry more meaning than any single interpretation can exhaust. AI systems should signal this inexhaustibility rather than implying closure. A response that says "the text means X" forecloses the interpretive possibilities that are the essence of theological engagement.

## 2.4 Synthesis: Epistemic Modesty as Design Principle

From personalism and hermeneutics, we derive **epistemic modesty** as a central design value:

1. **Acknowledge limitations**: The AI explicitly marks the boundaries of its competence
2. **Differentiate epistemic status**: Different types of claims receive different treatment
3. **Preserve agency**: The human researcher remains the primary interpreter
4. **Signal uncertainty**: Where genuine uncertainty exists, it is communicated

This is not merely a safety feature but a positive design value emerging from the nature of the subject matter. An AI designed with epistemic modesty is better suited to theological research not despite its humility but because of it.

## 2.5 Mapping Philosophy to Design

| Philosophical Principle | Design Implication | Technical Implementation |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Person as irreducible interpreter | Preserve hermeneutical journey | Narrative memory system |
| Dialogue over instrumentalism | Transparent, responsive interaction | Explicit epistemic indicators |
| Agency preservation | Human remains decision-maker | Confirmation-gated tools |
| Hermeneutical circle | Context-aware responses | Memory retrieval with relevance |
| Surplus of meaning | Signal interpretive openness | [DEFERRED] indicator |
