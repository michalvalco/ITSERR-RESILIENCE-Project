## Abstract

This paper proposes a personalist philosophical framework for designing AI systems that assist theological and religious studies scholarship. Drawing on personalist anthropology (Mounier, Buber, Wojtyla) and hermeneutical theory (Gadamer, Ricoeur), we argue that AI tools for humanities research must be designed with explicit attention to three principles: (1) preservation of the researcher's hermeneutical narrative across sessions, (2) epistemic modesty in distinguishing factual, interpretive, and deferred content, and (3) maintenance of human agency through transparent, confirmable tool invocation patterns.

We present a concrete implementation demonstrating these principles through three technical innovations: a narrative memory system that maintains contextual continuity using vector-based semantic retrieval; an epistemic indicator framework that classifies AI responses as `[FACTUAL]`, `[INTERPRETIVE]`, or `[DEFERRED]`; and a human-centered tool pattern that preserves researcher control over AI actions. The prototype integrates with GNORM, a CRF-based named entity recognition system for religious texts, demonstrating how existing digital humanities infrastructure can be augmented with epistemically-aware AI interfaces.

Our approach challenges the implicit positivism of conventional AI assistants, which tend to flatten the interpretive complexity of religious and theological texts. By grounding technical decisions in personalist philosophy, we offer a model for AI systems that respect both the nature of the subject matter and the dignity of the human researcher as irreducible interpreter.
