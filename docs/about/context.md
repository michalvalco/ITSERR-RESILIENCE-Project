# Project Context

Understanding the ITSERR/RESILIENCE ecosystem and how this project fits within it.

## RESILIENCE Research Infrastructure

**RESILIENCE** (*Religious Studies Infrastructure: tooLs, Innovation, Experts, coNnections and Centres in Europe*) is a European research infrastructure for religious studies.

### Mission

To provide researchers in religious studies with:

- Shared digital tools and platforms
- Access to collections and archives
- Collaboration networks
- Training and best practices

### ITSERR

**ITSERR** (*Italian Strengthening of the ESFRI RI RESILIENCE*) is the Italian national node of RESILIENCE, hosted by various Italian institutions and coordinated to enhance the infrastructure's capabilities.

## Work Package Connections

This project interfaces with several ITSERR work packages:

### WP3: T-ReS (Textual Research Services)

**Lead:** University of Palermo

**Connection:** Direct collaboration with the GNORM project team

- CRF-based annotation patterns
- Named entity recognition for religious texts
- Integration via API client

### WP4: DaMSym (Data Management & Symbolism)

**Focus:** Semantic textual analysis

**Connection:**

- Insights for memory architecture
- Patterns for scholarly metadata
- Semantic retrieval approaches

### WP6: YASMINE (ethicAl guidelineS for Managing data IN E-Infrastructures)

**Focus:** Ethical guidelines for AI and religious content

**Connection:**

- Epistemic modesty aligns with ethical transparency
- Deferred indicators respect normative boundaries
- Human-centered design follows ethical principles

### WP7: REVER (Representations of REligions in Visual sources)

**Focus:** Hermeneutical traditions in machine learning

**Connection:**

- Informs memory design for interpretive continuity
- Awareness of tradition-specific hermeneutics
- Visual analysis patterns (future integration)

### WP8: UbiQuity (Bibliography & Citation)

**Focus:** Citation networks and bibliographic challenges

**Connection:**

- Citation pattern recognition
- Reference management integration (future)
- Scholarly attribution practices
